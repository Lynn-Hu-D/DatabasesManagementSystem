## Project Introduction
- Seattle Travel Kit Is a web application that makes traveling in Seattle easy.

- Instead of boring travel books and complicated plans, it gives you your own travel
plan, tips from locals right when you need them, and an easy way to book everything.

- Travellers don't need to juggle between various apps such as Google map, Citizen,
Yelp, Airbnb, etc. when making travel plans.

### Features/capabilities:
- Destination Recommendation: Based on the user's preferences, recommend a list of
  potential destinations that align with their interests and constraints, including
  restaurants, hotels, cultural space
- Safety ratings: Integrate crime statistics and safety information for different
  neighborhoods and destinations, providing safety ratings for each suggested location
  based on historical crime data
